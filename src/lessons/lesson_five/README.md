# Lesson Five: Error Handling 

## Objectives 

* Understand the common error handling patterns 
* Review matching in the context of error handling
* Understand how to implement custom errors 

## Lesson:

This is an excellent article on error handling in rust.  https://blog.burntsushi.net/rust-error-handling/

The Rust Book and Rust By Example are a bit thin in this category, so the article is highly recommended.


### Homework 

There's a simple command-line application in lesson_five that takes one parameter.  If the parameter is great than 125, the program errors.  Use a Result<T, E> to improve the error handling.


### Homework Notes 

There are some examples in the /demos folder.
