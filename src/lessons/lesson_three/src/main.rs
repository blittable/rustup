//Basics of Traits - Homework

fn main() {

    //Create a struct that has String field

    //Create a trait that returns a String

    //Implement the trait for your struct

    //Call it from main()

    //Extra Credit:
    // 1) create a String value
    // 2) print the same string value returned from the trait above, but without using a struct, hint ::

}
